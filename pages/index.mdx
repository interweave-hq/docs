# Introduction

Welcome to Interweave!

If you hate writing CRUD forms so that you can manage data in your API, you're in the right place. Interweave is a platform for creating integrated frontends extremely fast-- tightly coupled to your database schema, version controlled, and automatically hosted. What does that mean? Imagine being able to create an entire interface from just a JSON object. As simple as:

```js
// Define what your data looks like
const interweaveObject = {
  keys: {
    title: {
      schema: {
        type: string
      }
    }
  },
  requests: {
    create: {
      uri: "https://dumbjson.com/titles"
    }
  }
};

// Sync with remote interface
buildInterface("titles", interweaveObject);
```

The example above uses Interweave Schema Syntax to define a configuration shape of our data. The configuration is then passed into `buildInterface`, along with a key that uniquely identifies our interface. After running this, you'll have a hosted form with validation in our (Studio)[https://my.interweave.studio]. This is the bare minimum you'd need to get started.

## Features

- 🚀 No custom code, no logic, all static
- 🔥 Blazing fast performance
- 🔒 Full TypeScript support
- 🤝 Lives where you define your database schema
- ♻️ Forms always in sync with your API
- 👁️ Easily generate from OpenAPI and any existing systems
- 🔄 Version controlled
- 🌏 Compatible with any language
- 🏗️ Configurable with your build process

## How does it work?

Interweave is made up of three parts:

- NPM package
- API that controls syncing
- Interweave Studio that generates the frontend

Since an Interweave configuration is entirely static, Interweave supports _any_ language that can write JSON and make requests.
