# TypeScript Support

All TypeScript interfaces can be [found here on GitHub](https://github.com/interweave-hq/interweave/blob/main/src/interfaces.ts). These interfaces might help you understand the API and what properties you should use.

## `InterfaceConfiguration` type

The `InterfaceConfiguration` type is very helpful for constructing interfaces. You can import a type `InterfaceConfiguration` to help write your configuration object.

```ts
import { type InterfaceConfiguration } from "@interweave/interweave"

const config: InterfaceConfiguration = { ... }
```
